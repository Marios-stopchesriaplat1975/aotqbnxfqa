Man, just saw Drop, and let me tell you, it was... something. You know how some  s just leave you wondering what the heck you just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥? Yeah, this is one of those. I’m still trying to figure out if it was genius or if I just wasted two hours of my life. Like, the visuals were on point, but the plot? A mess, dude. Seriously.

So, first things first, they should warn people about that much jumping around. I mean, pick a storyline, right? Just when I thought I knew where it was going, BAM – threw us into a totally different scene. It's like, guys, ever heard of story coherence?

> But, okay, props to the soundtrack. It had some beats that made me want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just for that. Not even kidding. I might’ve actually vibed with the whole thing if I wasn't dizzy half the time, trying to keep up with all that insanity.

Also, not gonna lie, the acting wasn’t half bad. They got some solid peeps onboard, I'll give them that. But then some characters just popped up outta nowhere, like WHERE did they come from? No backstory, no nothing, just hey, I'm here. Dude, what even was that?

And speaking of “what even,” the dialogue. Bruh, had moments where I legit thought they just wrote the whole thing in one night and couldn't be bothered to tweak it. Some lines were so cheesy, I laughed out loud, not in the good way. Is it weird that I kind of loved it though? A mess, but kinda my kind of mess. 

I was thinking I’d probably need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to catch it all, but my brain legit screamed “nah” and bailed on me halfway through that thought. It’s like being on a rollercoaster you didn’t really wanna board but now you’re here, just holding on.

public bool ThisMakesNoSense() { return false; }

Anyway, I'm kinda glad I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 it despite everything. You know how we always end up diving into these weird 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 just to see what happens? This was exactly that. Guess I’ll spend the next few days making sense of it all—or not. Just needed to rant a sec. I’m out.
